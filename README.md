# Code Instructions
The code you see in any of my projects in this repository requires you to use Turing or [Open Turing Project](https://github.com/Open-Turing-Project) as an IDE/editor. Notepad++ does not work as an IDE as Turing is not supported. You can however use Notepad++ as an editor, just not as an IDE. You might be able to use Sublime Text as another option.
